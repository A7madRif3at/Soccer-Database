# Soccer-Database
This soccer database comes from Kaggle and is well suited for data analysis and machine learning. It contains data for soccer matches, players, and teams from several European countries from 2008 to 2016. This dataset is quite extensive, and we encourage you to read more about it here.  The database is stored in a SQLite database. You can access database files using software like DB Browser. This dataset will help you get good practice with your SQL joins. Make sure to look at how the different tables relate to each other. Some column titles should be self-explanatory, and others youâ€™ll have to look up on Kaggle.
###Project: Investigate a Dataset - [Soccer Database]

##Introduction:-
#This is data for soccer matches, players, and teams from several European countries from 2008 to 2016. 

##project questions:-
# What teams improved the most over the time period?
# What team attributes lead to the most victories?
# Which players had the most penalties?

#Conclusions
#Results:
    #1. Teams improved the most over the time period ,we can follow up their performance more closely starting from season of 2013 ,with excluding some results from 2014 , as these teams their performace has been decreased for the next two years
    #2. Team attributes lead to the most victories,we should concentrate on defenceDefenderLineClass & chanceCreationShootingClass as there's correlations between this element and team performance 
    #3. players had the most penalties are Roberto Pereyra & Alessio Cerci
#Limitations :
    #1. Big matches need to be in seperate column with sorting the values as the follow (final or semi final) as this would be more helpful ,as stages are not enough for such info
    #2. As soccer fan there's some indicators are missing over here such as xG (The possibility of scoring goals) which is measuring the time between each goal for each player ,and this showing the stability in scoring for each player more than number of penalties ,at the end soccer is a group game not indiviual game.
